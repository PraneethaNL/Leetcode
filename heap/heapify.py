#Max_Heapify

#Similar logic can be applied for min_heapify

#The recursion exits when the left and right are out of bounds i.e if 'i' is index of leaf node
#the largest will remain i and the recurrsion stops.

#Time Complexity - O(log n)

def heapify(arr, N, i):
    largest = i  # Initialize largest as root
    l = 2 * i + 1     # left = 2*i + 1
    r = 2 * i + 2     # right = 2*i + 2
 
    # See if left child of root exists and is
    # greater than root
    if l < N and arr[largest] < arr[l]:
        largest = l
 
    # See if right child of root exists and is
    # greater than root
    if r < N and arr[largest] < arr[r]:
        largest = r
 
    # Change root, if needed
    if largest != i:
        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]  # swap
 
        # Heapify the root.
