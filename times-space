#### HEAP:

heappush() - log(n)
heappop() - log(n)
min or max - O(1)

heapify() - O(n)


heapify an already existing heap -converts a non heap into heap *IN PLACE* -  O(log n) / O(h) where h - height of the node at which heapify is applied.

***to create a heap out of a list(point to note I said list, not heapify an already existing heap) of n elements - O(n)***

heapify(nums) - takes O(n) time.

heappop() - O(log n) := O(1) to pop the top + O(log n ) to heapify the remaining heap.

heapify

building a max heap from a list of 'n' elements - O(n)  ( from the slides cse 310 fall'23)

heapsort = O(n log n)

findmax- O(1)
findmin - O(1)

###### LIST:

append = O(1)

len(l) = O(1)

min,max = O(n)

reverse = O(n)

pop = O(n)

ls.index() - O(n)

##### DICTIONARY:

len() = O(1)

insertion = O(1)
delete / pop - O(1)

eg: 
map.pop(key_to_be_popped)


######   SET:

len()=O(1)

insertion / add = O(1)

*****OPERATOR OVERLOADING IN PYTHON*****

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operator-overloading-in-python/

Consider that we have two objects which are a physical representation of a class (user-defined data type)
and we have to add two objects with binary ‘+’ operator it throws an error, 
because compiler don’t know how to add two objects. So we define a method for an operator and
that process is called operator overloading. We can overload all existing operators but we can’t create a new operator. 
To perform operator overloading, Python provides some special function or magic function that is automatically invoked when it is associated with that particular operator. 
For example, when we use + operator, the magic method __add__ is automatically invoked in which the operation for + operator is defined.

EG: overloading the '+' operator.

class A:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a
 
    # adding two objects 
    def __add__(self, o):
        return self.a + o.a 
ob1 = A(1)
ob2 = A(2)
ob3 = A("Geeks")
ob4 = A("For")
 
print(ob1 + ob2)
print(ob3 + ob4)
# Actual working when Binary Operator is used.
print(A.__add__(ob1 , ob2)) 
print(A.__add__(ob3,ob4)) 
#And can also be Understand as :
print(ob1.__add__(ob2))
print(ob3.__add__(ob4))
